      <p>
        Esayas Ftwi, PhD is an Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Addis
        Ababa University with more than 20 years of experience. His research interests generally relate
        to the performance assessment of RC structures subjected to combined mechanical,
        environmental, and material deterioration actions. His work spans multi-scale modeling and
        simulation of RC structures under fatigue, shrinkage, and corrosion actions; understanding the
        behavior of shear-critical RC members; early-age fatigue assessment of rigid concrete pavements.
        Additional interests include alternative cementitious materials for concrete. Currently, he is
        working on the development of low-carbon Engineered Cementitious Composite in collaboration
        with the Center for Low Carbon Built Environment at the University of Michigan. He has more
        than 35 publications in high-impact journals and conference proceedings.

      <p>
        He is also a practicing professional structural engineer and has been involved in the design and
        review of several high-rise building projects like CBE New HQ, bridges, rigid pavements, and
        strengthening of reinforced concrete structures. He has been involved in several mega projects
        including the GERD. He has worked as a project leader for the development of the Ethiopian
        Building Codes enforced in 2015. He has worked in several countries including Ethiopia, Japan,
        USA, Somalia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Djibouti.
      </p>

      <p>
        He served in various academic leadership positions and has led Addis Ababa Institute of
        Technology as an Executive Director for more than 5 years, with the rank of Vice President for
        Addis Ababa University.
